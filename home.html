	    Strange beautiful, grass of green
	    with your majestic silver seas
	    Your mysterious mountains I wish to see closer
	    May I land my kinky machine?
	    ... your world wonders me,
	    with your majestic and superior cackling hen
	    Your people I do not understand

	                                   Jimi Hendrix

<p>Logic is about many things, but most centrally it is about <i>logical consequences</i>. Physics is about real things, but most centrally it is about physical consequences, that is, <i>predictions</i>.</p> <p>The statement "someone is male" is a logical consequence of the statement "Grant is male". If Grant is male, then it <i>logically follows</i> that someone is male.</p>
